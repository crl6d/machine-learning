#Key results and performance evaluation: 
    #The public available data have been clustered based on DBSCAN algorithm introduced in the paper.
    #We can manually set a range of the parameters Eps and minPts. 
    #By running the algorithm with different values of Eps, we can see how these parameters influence the clustering process.
    #Our visualization shows the clusters and noise points in a 2D space
